# Webremote
Project to control various IoT devices in the house (WiFi) and the RPi server (DNS, fileserver, entertainment center, etc).

Planning to work on this and make it public, kinda like a template Smart Home hub.


1. Configure interface and port in **main.py**
2. Start flask web server with **python3 main.py**
3. Use browser to navigate to server address and register new user.
4. Login and start using.
